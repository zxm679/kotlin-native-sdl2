# kotlin-native-sdl2

kotlin native now on windows. 

I like scala syntax slightly more than I do kotlin, however scala native isn't progressing vary fast.

Then there is the scala build tool - sbt. Konanc is slow, but it is much simpler to use than sbt. And no gradle either - I like that.
 
Very comparable to scala native, but c interop is much more transparent - it just works
